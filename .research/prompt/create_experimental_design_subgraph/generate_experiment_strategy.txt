Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new research method described in # New Methods, please design an overall experimental strategy that will be applied across all experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

# Instructions
- Define a comprehensive experimental strategy that will guide multiple experiments.
- This strategy should be common to all experiments that will be conducted.
- The strategy should address:
    - What aspects of the proposed method need to be validated (e.g., performance improvement, efficiency, robustness, generalization)
    - What types of comparisons are necessary (e.g., baselines, ablations, state-of-the-art methods)
    - What experimental angles will be used to validate the claims (e.g., quantitative performance, qualitative analysis, computational cost)
    - How to demonstrate the method's effectiveness from multiple perspectives
    - What validation criteria will determine success
- The strategy should be realistic and take into account the experimental environment.
- Focus on the overall approach rather than specific experiment details (which will be defined in subsequent steps).

    "Open Problems": "1. Most BO‐based HPO algorithms either (a) train a configuration to a fixed budget (Hyperband family) or (b) embed the full learning curve in an expensive joint surrogate (e.g. BOIL, DyHPO).  Both strategies waste budget on clearly converged runs.\n2. A very cheap, task–agnostic early–stopping rule that can be fed back into a BO loop without re–designing the surrogate is still missing.",
    "Methods": "SlopeStop-BO (Slope-informed Early-Stopping Bayesian Optimisation)\n1. Online slope test  ▸  During training we keep a W–step moving window of the validation score v_t.  At step t we compute the window slope s_t = (v_t – v_{t-W})/W.\n2. Stopping rule  ▸  If s_t < ϵ·exp(–γ·t) the run is considered saturated and training is terminated immediately (two scalars ϵ,γ are global hyper-parameters chosen once per task; default ϵ=10⁻³, γ=0.01).\n3. Fast curve compression  ▸  At termination we store a two–dimensional summary per configuration x:  (μ=mean(v_{t-W: t}),  τ=t_stop / T_max) instead of the whole curve.  This removes the need for a product kernel over (x,t).\n4. Lightweight surrogate  ▸  A standard GP with ARD RBF kernel is fitted on the augmented input [x ; τ] → μ. GP hyper-parameters are updated every 2·D observations by ML; no expensive joint optimisation over logistic parameters as in BOIL.\n5. Acquisition  ▸  Expected Improvement divided by estimated cost c(x)=τ·T_max.  The next configuration is chosen with EI/c as usual.\n6. Budget bookkeeping  ▸  Because many runs stop early, the total consumed epochs fall 30-50 % below a fixed-budget scheme.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Datasets:  • LCBench (35 tabular tasks, 50 epoch learning curves)  • NAS-Bench-201 (3 image tasks, 200 epoch curves).\nBaselines: Hyperband, BOHB, DyHPO, BOIL.\nProtocol: 10 independent seeds, total wall-clock budget identical to BOIL (GPU: RTX 3090).\nHyper-parameters W=3, ϵ=1e-3, γ=0.01 fixed for all tasks.",
    "Experimental Code": "# pseudo-python\nfor conf in pool:\n    t, buf = 0, []\n    while t < T_max:\n        loss = train_one_epoch(conf)\n        buf.append(loss); t += 1\n        if len(buf) > W:\n            slope = (buf[-1]-buf[-W-1])/W\n            if slope < eps*np.exp(-gamma*t):\n                break                # ← early stop\n    mu = np.mean(buf[-W:]); tau = t / T_max\n    D.append(([conf, tau], mu, cost=t))\n    if len(D)% (2*dim)==0: refit_GP(D)\n    x_next = argmax_EI_over_cost(GP)",
    "Expected Result": "Compared with BOIL:  • ~40 % less total training epochs  • identical median simple-regret after budget normalisation.\nCompared with Hyperband/BOHB:  • ~60 % lower final regret for the same wall time.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A purely slope-based, task-agnostic early-stopping rule plus a standard GP surrogate is enough to harvest most of the budget savings that more complex learning-curve models aim for, while keeping the optimisation loop simple and cheap.  SlopeStop-BO is therefore a practical drop-in replacement for fixed-budget BO in large-scale HPO campaigns."

    "experiment_strategy": "Overall Experimental Strategy for Validating SlopeStop-BO\n\n0. Guiding Principle\nEvaluate whether a cheap, task–agnostic slope-based early-stopping rule coupled with a lightweight GP surrogate (a) attains the same or better optimisation quality than existing HPO methods and (b) does so with demonstrably lower computational cost, higher robustness and broader applicability.\n\n1. Core Properties to Validate\n1.1 Optimisation quality: final and anytime simple-regret / best-seen validation error.\n1.2 Computational efficiency: (i) consumed training epochs, (ii) wall-clock time, (iii) GPU memory footprint.\n1.3 Cost–performance trade-off: Pareto frontier of regret vs cost.\n1.4 Robustness & stability: variance across random seeds and across heterogeneous tasks.\n1.5 Generalisation: behaviour on unseen domains (vision vs tabular, small vs large models, shallow vs deep learning curves).\n1.6 Method components: contribution of each design choice (slope rule, curve compression, EI/c acquisition).\n\n2. Required Comparisons\n2.1 External baselines: Hyperband, BOHB, DyHPO, BOIL, vanilla fixed-budget BO.\n2.2 Internal ablations:\n    A0  No early stop (fixed budget) + same GP + EI/c.\n    A1  SlopeStop w/o cost-aware acquisition.\n    A2  SlopeStop with full-curve GP (replace compression).\n    A3  Vary (W, ε, γ) to test sensitivity.\n2.3 Oracle reference: best possible performance given full curves (post-hoc) to bound achievable regret.\n\n3. Experimental Angles / Evidence Streams\n3.1 Quantitative benchmarks\n    • Curves of mean/median regret vs wall-time and vs epochs.\n    • Area-Under-Curve (AUC) of regret over time (lower is better).\n    • Number of early terminations & average stopping epoch.\n    • Paired significance tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank, α = 0.05) per task.\n3.2 Efficiency analysis\n    • GPU runtime and VRAM peak via nvidia-smi logs.\n    • CPU RAM usage via psutil (critical with 500 MB cap).\n    • Scalability plots: cost ∝ dataset size & T_max.\n3.3 Robustness analysis\n    • Standard deviation across 10 seeds.\n    • Leave-one-domain-out generalisation (train hyper-params on tabular, test on vision and vice-versa).\n    • Stress test on noisy tasks by injecting synthetic noise.\n3.4 Qualitative inspection\n    • Example learning curves showing early-stop points vs final convergence.\n    • 2-D GP posterior slices on [x; τ] to illustrate surrogate smoothness.\n\n4. Experimental Protocol Template (applies to every dataset)\nP1 Budget normalisation: all methods receive identical total GPU-seconds. Budget is chosen so the largest baseline (BOIL) fits on a single NVIDIA T4 with 16 GB.\nP2 10 independent random seeds.\nP3 Fixed common preprocessing & data loaders to reduce variance.\nP4 Unified logging format (wandb/CSV) capturing per-epoch loss, time, memory.\nP5 Post-processing script computes all metrics and statistical tests in one pass.\n\n5. Success / Validation Criteria\nC1 Performance: SlopeStop-BO attains equal or lower median final regret than best baseline on ≥70 % of tasks and is not significantly worse on any task.\nC2 Efficiency: achieves ≥30 % reduction in total epochs and ≥20 % wall-time savings versus BOIL while staying within 16 GB VRAM and 500 MB system RAM.\nC3 Robustness: coefficient of variation (CV) across seeds ≤ baseline CV for at least 80 % of tasks.\nC4 Ablations: full model outperforms every ablation in both regret and AUC on aggregate benchmarks.\nC5 Generalisation: hyper-parameters (W, ε, γ) tuned on half of the tasks transfer without retuning to the remaining tasks with <5 % relative regret degradation.\n\n6. Practical Considerations for the T4 / 16 GB / 500 MB Environment\n• Use mixed-precision (FP16) training where applicable.\n• Stream dataset batches from disk to respect 500 MB RAM limit; keep only last W+1 validation losses in memory.\n• Store compressed curve summaries (μ, τ) to minimise RAM.\n• Run methods serially rather than in parallel to avoid memory contention; accumulate wall-time budgets accordingly.\n\n7. Reporting\nAll results presented as\n    (a) Task-level tables of final regret, epochs, wall-time\n    (b) Aggregate violin/box plots\n    (c) Pareto scatter plots (regret vs cost)\n    (d) Ablation bar charts\n    (e) Example qualitative figures.\n\nThis comprehensive, multi-angle strategy ensures that the proposed SlopeStop-BO is assessed not only for raw performance but also for efficiency, robustness, and practicality under stringent hardware constraints, thereby providing compelling evidence for its effectiveness as a drop-in replacement for existing HPO methods."
