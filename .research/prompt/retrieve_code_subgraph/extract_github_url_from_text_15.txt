# Paper Outline
The methodology centers on `qEHVI`, an extension of Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI). `qEHVI` calculates the joint Hypervolume Improvement (HVI) of `q` candidate points using box decompositions and the inclusion-exclusion principle to handle non-rectangular polytopes in the non-dominated space. The expected value of HVI is estimated via Monte-Carlo (MC) integration, sampling from the joint posterior of a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model; randomized quasi-MC methods are employed to reduce variance. Exact gradients of the MC estimator are computed using auto-differentiation and the re-parameterization trick, enabling gradient-based optimization. The Sample Average Approximation (SAA) approach is utilized for faster convergence with deterministic, higher-order optimizers. For constrained optimization, feasibility weighting is applied at the sample level, and indicator functions are replaced with differentiable sigmoid approximations to maintain differentiability.
