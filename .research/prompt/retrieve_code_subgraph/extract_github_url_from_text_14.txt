# Paper Outline
The methodology involves both theoretical analysis and empirical studies. Theoretically, the paper investigates how reshuffling affects the empirical loss surface by deriving the limiting distribution of the sequence of validation losses. It models the observed loss as a true loss plus a zero-mean Gaussian process with a covariance kernel that changes with reshuffling. A bound on the expected regret is derived, dependent on the loss surface's curvature, noise correlation, and a reshuffling parameter (τ). Empirically, a simulation study uses a univariate quadratic loss surface with a squared exponential kernel for the noise process to systematically vary curvature (m), noise correlation (κ), and reshuffling extent (τ). Benchmark experiments are conducted using random search, HEBO, and SMAC3 as HPO algorithms on various real-world tabular datasets and learning algorithms (CatBoost, XGBoost, Elastic Net, MLP) to measure generalization performance using ROC AUC, accuracy, and logloss. Resampling strategies like holdout, M-fold CV, M-fold holdout, and their reshuffled variants are compared.
