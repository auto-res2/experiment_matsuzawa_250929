# Paper Outline
DyHPO is a Bayesian Optimization method based on Gaussian Processes (GP). It proposes a deep kernel for GPs that embeds the learning curve dynamics, capturing the similarity of hyperparameter configurations evaluated at different budgets. The feature extractor (φ) for the kernel uses a neural network composed of linear and convolutional layers, taking hyperparameter configuration, normalized budget, and the past learning curve as input. An acquisition function, Multi-Fidelity Expected Improvement (EIMF), is introduced, which extends Expected Improvement to the multi-budget case by dynamically adjusting the incumbent configuration based on the budget. The algorithm dynamically selects the most promising candidate to train for a small additional budget (incrementally increasing budget by one epoch/step) at each HPO step, updating the surrogate model after observing the new data point.
