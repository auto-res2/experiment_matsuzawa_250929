# Paper Outline
PASHA is an extension of ASHA, inspired by the 'doubling trick' concept. It starts with a small initial maximum amount of resources and progressively increases them only if the ranking of configurations in the top two rungs (rounds of promotion) has not stabilized. The key idea is to stop early when rankings are stable. To handle noise in the training process, PASHA employs a 'soft ranking' mechanism, where configurations are considered equivalent if their performance difference is smaller than a dynamically estimated value ϵ. This ϵ value is automatically estimated by identifying pairs of configurations that repeatedly swap their ranks across different resource levels (criss-crossing behavior) and calculating it as the N-th (90th in experiments) percentile of the performance differences of these criss-crossing pairs.
