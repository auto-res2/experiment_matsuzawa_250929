# Paper Outline
The methodology leverages box decompositions and the inclusion-exclusion principle to compute the Hypervolume Improvement (HVI) for `q` candidate points. Expected HVI (EHVI) is then estimated using Monte-Carlo (MC) integration with samples drawn from the joint posterior of a Gaussian Process surrogate model, utilizing randomized quasi-MC methods for variance reduction. Exact gradients of the MC-estimator are computed via auto-differentiation, employing the re-parameterization trick. This enables optimization through the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) framework, which allows for deterministic, higher-order optimizers and offers theoretical convergence guarantees. Constraints are incorporated by feasibility-weighting on the sample level, using a differentiable sigmoid approximation for the indicator function, effectively treating constraints as additional objectives in the hypervolume calculation. The approach supports both joint batch and sequential greedy optimization strategies.
