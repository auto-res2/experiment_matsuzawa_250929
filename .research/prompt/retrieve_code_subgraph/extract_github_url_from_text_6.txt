# Paper Outline
BOIL employs a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework with a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model that spans the joint space of input hyperparameters (x) and training iterations (t). A product kernel `k([x,t],[x',t']) = k(x,x') × k(t,t')` is used, and the training time cost `c(x,t)` is approximated by a linear regressor. The acquisition function is a modified Expected Improvement (EI), which is optimized against cost (`α(x,t)/µc(x,t)`). A key technique is "training curve compression" where raw learning curves are transformed into a numeric utility score using a Sigmoid (Logistic) preference function, whose parameters (`m0`, `g0`) are learned by maximizing the GP log marginal likelihood. Furthermore, a data augmentation technique is utilized to selectively add points from the learning curve, choosing samples at the maximum of GP predictive uncertainty while ensuring the natural log of the GP covariance matrix condition number remains below a set threshold (δ).
